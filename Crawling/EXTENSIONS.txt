# How to extend this solution

1. Products outside of the Household Essentials category:

To extend this, instead of having `CRAWL_TARGET` you can have an array and loop
through it. Also, for more products you can extend the `MAX_LISTING_PAGES` to
a higher number.

2. Domains beyond Walgreens.com:

Most likely, the structure of the HTML will be different. You will need to
either write a different solution or encapsulate some of the logic and switch
it based on the domain.

For example, to get to the category product listing you could have a function
that takes in the domain and navigates to the category page. Same for the
`getProductData` function.

3. Lambda and Docker:

Given that `@sparticuz/chromium` is used, this solution can be easily deployed
to AWS Lambda or any docker (linux 64 based) environment. A bonus comes from
storing the chromium binary in an S3 bucket and downloading it on the fly
when the container is created. This way, you can have a slim function/image
and not have to worry about the size of the chromium binary (50MB+ compressed).
